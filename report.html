                <li>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?
                    <ul>
                        I just picked some stuff that would add information like my steam stats or pictures of the game.
                    </ul><br>

                <li>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?
                    <ul>
                        Mostly just in class but over email a couple of times.
                    </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?
                    <ul>
                        Yeah, they did a good job.

                <li>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?
                    <ul>
                        I will try harder to make sure I am part of the process so the website is what I want.

                <li>How did you manage your development team and communicate tasks?
                    <ul>
                        It was a little hard to manage my team since there wasn't really anyhing I could give them until the client gave us enough information on the site plan.
                    </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?
                    <ul>
                        I communicated via text messages. The site plan lacked details so I had to keep asking for clarification.
                    </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li>How did you handle publishing your client site?
                    <ul>
                        It was pretty easy since I just had to set up a new repository and push the code there.
                    </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li>How was your experience managing GitHub?
                    <ul>
                        It wasn't too bad, there were a couple times that github pages didn't work when the live server would.
                    </ul>

                        I communicated mostly through in-person conversations during class time and a couple of emails.

            <ul>
                <li>What was the most challenging part of this project?
                    <ul>
                        It was really hard to communicate with everyone and make sure we were all on the same page.
                    </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li>What did you enjoy most?
                    <ul>
                        I actually really enjoyed the process of being a client and making a wireframe and site plan for someone else to build my site with my help.
                    </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li>What would you do differently?
                    <ul>
                        I would try and be more involved with each person so that the final product would have been closer to what we wanted.
                    </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li>Do you feel more confident working on real projects?
                    <ul>
                        I definitely feel more confident in working on real projects now that I know how to work with each part of the team.
